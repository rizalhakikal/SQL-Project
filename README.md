## üìå **About This Repository**  
Welcome to my SQL portfolio repository! Here, I showcase a collection of projects where I leverage **Structured Query Language (SQL)** to analyze datasets, extract actionable insights, and solve real-world problems. These projects demonstrate my proficiency in:  
- Writing efficient SQL queries for data extraction and transformation.  
- Performing exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover trends and patterns.  
- Building dashboards and reports using query results.  

This repository is perfect for anyone looking to learn SQL or explore practical use cases of SQL in data science and analytics.

## üåü **Key Features of My Projects**  
1. **Data Exploration**: Extracting meaningful information from raw datasets.  
2. **Aggregation & Filtering**: Summarizing data using `GROUP BY`, `HAVING`, and advanced filtering techniques.  
3. **Joins & Relationships**: Combining multiple tables to answer complex questions.  
4. **Window Functions**: Leveraging advanced SQL features like `ROW_NUMBER()`, `RANK()`, and `OVER()` for detailed analysis.  
5. **Performance Optimization**: Writing efficient queries to handle large datasets.
